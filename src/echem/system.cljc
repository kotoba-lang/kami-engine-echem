  "Net system-level operating point for the ROM PEM fuel cell
  (:rom-fc-system) — the bridge between the stack ROM's :eff-LHV
  (stack-only, polarization-curve basis) and the vehicle plane's
  :fc-elec-eff (H2(LHV) → electric *system* efficiency, stack + BoP).

  Boundary advanced: `:pem-fuel-cell` + `:dc-dc-and-dc-bus` of the
  magnesium-hydrogen-PEMFC electric-drive boundary — the vehicle plane
  consumes H2 through `:fc-elec-eff` (kami-engine-vehicle-designer
  vdesign.powertrain/tech, vdesign.hydrogen/consumption-profile,
  vdesign.endurance), and its own docstrings declare the operating-point
  dependence (polarization, BoP parasitics) UNMEASURED. On main there is
  no executable contract that decomposes a system efficiency into the
  stack part (the ROM's own number) and the BoP part, so a vehicle-plane
  :fc-elec-eff can silently claim a stack efficiency the ROM never
  produced. This contract is that decomposition, inverted:

    gross stack power  P-stack = ṁ·LHV·eta-stack      (ROM identity)
    BoP parasitic load P-bop   = caller-supplied (kW or fraction)
    net bus power      P-net    = P-stack − P-bop
    system efficiency  eta-sys  = P-net / (ṁ·LHV)
                              = eta-stack · (1 − P-bop/P-stack)

  The identity is exact given the caller's numbers — the ROM's :eff-LHV
  and :stack-kW are reused verbatim (echem.solver/solve-at-power output),
  no efficiency or parasitic constant is invented here.

  BoP input forms (exactly one):
    :bop-kw      — absolute parasitic power at this operating point
    :bop-frac    — parasitic power as a fraction of GROSS stack power

  An optional :dc-dc-eff in (0, 1] composes the DC/DC stage:
    P-bus = P-net · dc-dc-eff,  eta-bus = eta-sys · dc-dc-eff

  Refusals (fail closed, never guessed): non-finite/non-positive stack
  power, :eff-lhv outside (0, 1), :bop-kw negative or ≥ gross stack
  power (net power must stay positive — a BoP that eats the whole stack
  is an infeasible operating point, reported by refusing, mirroring
  echem.stack-thermal's discipline), :bop-frac outside [0, 1), both or
  neither BoP form supplied, :dc-dc-eff outside (0, 1].

  Unmeasured (declared on every result, never numeric): BoP's own
  operating-point dependence (compressor/turbine/coolant-pump power
  curves vs current density), startup/shutdown parasitics, purge and
  recirculation flows, DC/DC part-load efficiency curve. The caller's
  provenance strings (:bop-source, :dc-dc-source) are REQUIRED and
  echoed — an efficiency claim travels with its evidence or the call
  fails."
